## The Payment Layer For The Agent Economy

AiFinPay Paywall turns HTTP `402 Payment Required` into a production-grade payment handshake for AI agents. A merchant can price any API action, content object, data query, or compute job. An agent can discover the price, pay automatically within policy, receive a cryptographic receipt, and retry the original request without a human checkout screen.

    Agent["AI Agent"] -->|1. Request protected resource| Merchant["Merchant API"]
    Merchant -->|2. HTTP 402 payment challenge| Agent
    Agent -->|3. Quote + pay| AIFP["AiFinPay Control Plane"]

    AIFP -->|5. Signed receipt token| Agent
    Agent -->|6. Retry with receipt| Merchant
    Merchant -->|7. Verify locally + grant access| Agent
```

### Why This Exists

| Today | Problem For Agents | AiFinPay |
|---|---|---|
| Ads | Agents do not view or click ads | Per-action machine payments |
| Subscriptions | Agents touch too many sources | Stateless paid receipts scoped to resources |
| Manual API keys | Discovery and onboarding are too slow | Machine-readable `402` challenge |
| Card checkout | Fees exceed tiny machine-action value | Micropayments with wallet policy |
| Bot blocking | Providers lose agent demand | Monetize machine traffic safely |

## How AIFP Relates to x402

x402 established a practical model for using HTTP `402 Payment Required` as a payment interaction
between clients and protected resources. AIFP-1 uses the same HTTP foundation and extends it into a
broader protocol surface for autonomous AI agents, merchant APIs, wallets, receipts, policy controls,
and machine-to-machine commerce. The intent is compatibility and specialization, not replacement.

### Key Differences

- x402 standardized HTTP `402 Payment Required` payment interactions for web resources.
- AIFP adopts the same foundation while expanding the protocol for autonomous AI agents.
- AIFP introduces quote negotiation, receipt lifecycle, wallet policies, merchant-side verification, governance, SDKs, and protocol specifications.
- AIFP targets machine-to-machine commerce where software can discover, purchase, and access digital resources autonomously.
- The two approaches are complementary, and AIFP can coexist with x402-based ecosystems.

## Product Surface

| Surface | What It Does | Primary Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol | HTTP 402 challenge, quote, payment, receipt, retry | [AIFP-1 RFC](docs/aifp/01-AIFP-1-RFC-Payment-Protocol-Specification.md) |
| Merchant SDK | Protect routes, price actions, verify receipts locally | [Merchant Integration](docs/aifp/02-Merchant-Integration-Guide.md) |
| Agent SDK | Detect paywalls, quote, pay, retry, enforce budgets | [Agent SDK Spec](docs/aifp/03-AI-Agent-SDK-Specification.md) |
| Wallet Layer | Bind wallets, budgets, assets, rails, settlement policy | [Wallet Guide](docs/wallet.md) |
| Receipt Authority | Ed25519 receipt token issuance and verification | [Security Spec](docs/aifp/04-Security-and-Cryptography-Specification.md) |
| Developer Portal | OpenAPI, JSON schemas, Postman, examples, SDK references | [Docs Portal](docs/index.md) |
| Governance | AIP proposal flow, ecosystem roles, conformance | [AIP Process](docs/aifp/06-AIP-Improvement-Proposal-Process.md) |

## Pricing For Agent Actions

| Tier | Starts From | Intended Workload |
|---|---:|---|
| `standard` | `$0.00001` | Simple read, single record, lightweight API request |
| `complex` | `$0.00006` | Search, aggregation, multi-source queries, higher compute |
| `premium` | `$0.00010` | AI inference, GPU workloads, deep analytics, premium data |

AiFinPay charges a **1% protocol fee** on successful transactions. The remaining **99% settles to the merchant**, excluding any applicable payment-network, gas, processor, or settlement costs.

```

AiFinPay separates the control plane from the merchant data plane. Merchants verify receipt tokens locally, so access checks remain fast and resilient. The control plane handles quotes, wallet authorization, settlement, receipts, key rotation, and webhooks.
