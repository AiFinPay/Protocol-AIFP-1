# x402 Flow

The x402 flow is the payment handshake that turns a protected HTTP request into a paid retry.
It starts when a merchant returns `402 Payment Required` and ends when the merchant verifies a
receipt locally and serves the original resource.

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `402 Payment Required` | An HTTP status that says the resource is available after payment |
| Payment challenge | The machine-readable payload that explains what to pay, where to pay, and how long the offer is valid |
| Quote | A binding price for a specific resource and tier |
| Receipt token | A signed proof of payment, usually a JWT signed with Ed25519 |
| Nonce | A single-use random value that prevents replay |
| JWKS | JSON Web Key Set, the merchant-facing key set used to verify receipts |

## The Loop

    autonumber
    participant Client as Developer app / agent
    participant Merchant as Merchant API
    participant AIFP as AiFinPay

    Client->>Merchant: Request protected resource
    Merchant-->>Client: 402 Payment Required + challenge
    Client->>AIFP: Request quote
    AIFP-->>Client: Quote with amount, tier, nonce, expiry
    Client->>AIFP: Submit payment
    AIFP-->>Client: Receipt token
    Client->>Merchant: Retry with receipt
    Merchant->>Merchant: Verify receipt locally
    Merchant-->>Client: 200 OK
```

## What Happens Under The Hood

1. The merchant chooses a pricing tier and returns a challenge instead of serving the resource.
2. The client asks for a quote and receives the exact price, resource scope, and expiry.
3. The client pays through AiFinPay and receives a signed receipt token.
4. The merchant verifies signature, audience, resource, amount, expiry, and nonce locally, then serves the request.
