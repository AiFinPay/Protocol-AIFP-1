# AIFP Improvement Proposal (AIP) Process

**Document:** AIFP-DOC-06 · **Version:** 1.0.0 · **Governed by:** AIFP-1 (Doc 01)
**Status:** Active · Modeled on Ethereum EIPs, Python PEPs, and the IETF RFC process.

> An **AIP** (AiFinPay Improvement Proposal) is the formal mechanism for proposing,
> debating, and ratifying changes to the AiFinPay Paywall Protocol (AIFP) and its
> ecosystem. AIP-1 (this process) is itself an AIP and may only be changed by an AIP.

---

## 1. Purpose

The AIP process exists to make protocol evolution **transparent, reviewable, and
backward-compatibility-aware**. It ensures that any change to AIFP-1, its APIs, schemas,
SDKs, or governance is documented, discussed in the open, and ratified by a defined body
before it becomes normative.

---

## 2. AIP Types

| Type | Scope | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Standards Track** | Changes to the protocol itself (wire format, endpoints, receipts, errors, networks). | New error code, new settlement chain, receipt claim addition. |
| **Meta** | Changes to processes, governance, or the AIP process itself. | Amending this document; changing the review board. |
| **Informational** | Guidelines, best practices, design notes; non-binding. | Recommended retry tuning; security advisories. |

Standards Track AIPs are further sub-categorized: **Core** (protocol semantics),
**Interface** (APIs/SDKs/schemas), **Networks** (chain support), **Security**.

## 3. Proposal Lifecycle

```text
   Idea ──► Draft ──► Review ──► Last Call ──► Accepted ──► Final
                 │         │                        │
                 └─────────┴────────────────────────┴──► Rejected / Withdrawn / Stagnant
                                                          Superseded (by a later AIP)
```

| Status | Meaning | Entry criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **Draft** | Formally tracked, assigned an AIP number. | Author opens PR; meets template & formatting. |
| **Review** | Under active community + editor review. | Editor marks ready; discussion thread open. |
| **Last Call** | Final 14-day window for objections. | Review complete; no unresolved blocking issues. |
| **Accepted** | Approved by the review board; awaiting reference implementation. | Board sign-off after Last Call. |
| **Final** | Normative. Part of the protocol. | Reference implementation merged + conformance tests pass. |
| **Rejected** | Declined with recorded rationale. | Board decision or author abandonment after review. |
| **Withdrawn** | Author retracts. | Author request. |
| **Stagnant** | Inactive >6 months in Draft/Review. | Auto-marked; may be resurrected. |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by a newer Final AIP. | Successor reaches Final. |

A Standards Track AIP **cannot reach Final without a working reference implementation and
passing conformance tests** (Doc 14).

## 4. Governance Process

**4.1. Roles.**
- **Author(s)** — write and champion the AIP.
- **AIP Editors** — enforce formatting, assign numbers, manage status transitions
  (process, not merit).
- **Review Board** — domain maintainers (protocol, security, SDK, networks) who
  evaluate technical merit and vote.
- **Community** — anyone may comment; substantive objections must be addressed.

**4.2. Decision rule.** Acceptance requires **rough consensus** of the Review Board with
**no unresolved blocking security objection**. Security-categorized AIPs require explicit
sign-off from the Security maintainer. Ties default to the **status quo** (reject).

**4.3. Transparency.** All discussion happens in public (GitHub Discussions / PRs).
Decisions are recorded in the AIP header (`Resolution:` link).

---

## 5. Versioning & Backward Compatibility

AIFP follows **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) at the protocol level:

- **PATCH** — editorial/clarification; no wire change.
- **MINOR** — backward-compatible additions (new optional field, new error code, new
  network, new endpoint). Existing clients keep working.
- **MAJOR** — breaking change. Requires a migration AIP, a deprecation window, and
  parallel support of the previous MAJOR for **≥12 months**.

**Compatibility rules (normative for any AIP):**
1. New required request fields are a **breaking** change (MAJOR).
2. New optional fields and new response fields are **non-breaking** (MINOR).
3. Removing or renaming any field/endpoint/error is **breaking** (MAJOR).
4. Receipt claim changes must preserve verification of previously issued receipts within
   their TTL.
5. The **Protocol Negotiation Layer** (AIFP-1 §22.3) MUST be used to gate any
   capability that isn't universally available.

---

## 6. Reference Implementation Rules

- Every Standards Track AIP MUST link a reference implementation before **Final**.
- The implementation MUST pass the AIFP **conformance test suite** (Doc 14) and update it
  if new behavior is introduced.
- Code examples in the AIP MUST match the OpenAPI spec (Doc 08), JSON Schemas (Doc 10),
  and SDK Reference (Doc 11). Drift is a blocking review issue.

---

## 7. Community Contributions & RFC Process

1. **Idea / RFC.** Open a Discussion describing the problem and proposed direction. Gather
   early feedback (the lightweight "RFC" stage).
2. **Draft AIP.** Fork the AIP template, fill all sections, open a PR. An Editor assigns
   the next AIP number.
3. **Review → Last Call → Accepted → Final.** Per §3.
4. **Contributor License.** Contributions are licensed Apache-2.0 (Doc 13 §code style /
   Doc 15 contribution guide). A DCO sign-off is required.

## 9. Example AIPs

### AIP-1 — AIFP Improvement Proposal Process *(Meta, Final)*
This document. Defines the process by which all other AIPs are created and ratified.

### AIP-2 — Core Payment Protocol *(Standards Track · Core, Final)*
**Abstract.** Ratifies AIFP-1 (Doc 01) as the normative protocol: HTTP-402 challenge,
quote/pay/receipt loop, Ed25519 stateless receipts (TTL 600s), agent action pricing tiers
(Standard from $0.00001 / Complex from $0.00006 / Premium from $0.00010), 1% AiFinPay
protocol fee, merchant settlement of the remaining 99% excluding applicable network or
settlement costs, idempotency (24h), and error registry. **Backward Compatibility:**
baseline; nothing to break.

### AIP-7 — Add Unichain to Full Core Networks *(Standards Track · Networks, Final)*
**Abstract.** Adds Unichain to the Full Core tier (Core + Passport + mSECCO + Pyth),
bringing supported networks to **12**. **Spec:** add `unichain` to the `chain` enum
(Doc 08/10), publish payout-address format, extend conformance vectors. **Backward
Compatibility:** MINOR — new optional chain; existing clients unaffected.

### AIP-12 — Agent Passport & Reputation Network *(Standards Track · Core, Final)*
**Abstract.** Introduces `pp_*` Agent Passports with Ed25519 identity, reputation
∈ [0,1000] (start 500), risk ∈ [0,100], and trust levels
(untrusted/basic/verified/enterprise). Adds `POST /v1/passports`, `GET /v1/passports/{id}`.
**Backward Compatibility:** MINOR — additive endpoints and optional challenge fields.

### AIP-19 — `AIFP-403-BUDGET-EXCEEDED` Error *(Standards Track · Interface, Final)*
**Abstract.** Adds a dedicated error for budget-policy breaches at `POST /v1/pay`.
**Spec:** new code in the registry (Doc 01 App. C / Doc 08). **Backward Compatibility:**
MINOR — new error code under existing `403` semantics.

### AIP-23 — Streaming Payments via mSECCO Channels *(Standards Track · Core, Accepted)*
**Abstract.** Defines payment channels for high-frequency metered consumption with escrow
bound to the Agent Passport. **Status:** Accepted; awaiting reference implementation +
conformance vectors before Final. **Backward Compatibility:** MINOR — opt-in capability
gated by Protocol Negotiation.

### AIP-31 — Dynamic Pricing Reputation Discount Cap *(Informational)*
**Abstract.** Recommends clamping dynamic prices to `[min,max]` and capping
reputation-based discounts at **−30%** to prevent gaming. Non-binding guidance for
merchants implementing the Dynamic Pricing Engine.
